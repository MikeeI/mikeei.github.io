[{"content":" Make Your Own PCBs with a 3D Printer Conceived on Feb 14, 2020\nSeries: sideprojects, cad, hardware\nListen, anyone can make a PCB at home, it’s easy. All you need is a laser printer, some glossy magazine pages, print your circuit onto the page, use a clothes iron to transfer the toner onto your copper clad, if that doesn’t work use some water and some lacquer or something, I don’t know, I stopped reading at that point because the last time I saw a laser printer, a magazine and a clothes iron was in the nineties.\nUntil recently, the only ways I knew to make PCBs was to practice the dark art above, to pay $10 and wait three weeks to get professional-looking PCBs from China, or to pay $60 and wait three days to get professional-looking PCBs from Europe. It was “cheap, fast, actually doable by a human person, choose two”.\nThat always bugged me, it shouldn’t be like that, I have always been of the opinion that there shouldn’t be things you can’t make when you have a 3D printer, but PCBs have consistently eluded me. I yearned for them, I wanted to be able to make them at home, but it seemed impossible.\nOne day, everything changed.\nThat One Day When Everything Changed One day, I thought it would be fun to mount a pen onto my 3D printer and got it to draw stuff on paper. If you don’t know how a 3D printer works, now would be a good time to skim my 3D printer primer, but in summary a 3D printer cuts an object into 2D slices and prints them on top of each other.\nIf I could take just one of these slices and tell the printer to print higher, then the nozzle wouldn’t be touching the bed, I could mount the pen lower and put a piece of paper under it, and it would draw on the paper. Getting the printing software (called a slicer) to create a 3-dimensional shape out of a photo was easy, as you can just import a drawing and it will automatically convert it to a solid.\nI rubber-banded a Sharpie onto a holder I quickly designed, and, a few lines of code later, my printer produced this gem (excuse quality of potato):\nI felt so proud of the completely useless thing I had created, I immediately ran to share it everywhere. A friend saw it on Twitter and replied that this was a good way to make PCBs.\nI was immediately intrigued.\nMaking PCBs with Markers Apparently, all that black magic about printing and transferring and magazines and lacquer above is just a way to keep the etching acid from dissolving the copper. You see, when you’re etching a PCB, you’re basically getting acid to dissolve the copper on your copper clad (the blank PCB). Except, you’re putting something (toner) over the copper on the parts you want to keep, so the acid can’t get to it, which leaves you with copper traces.\nIt turns out you don’t really need to do all that stuff with the toner and printer, since you can cover the copper much more easily just by drawing over it with a permanent, waterproof marker (I used an Edding 140 S 0.3mm). I had inadvertently created a plotter, which can be used for painting a circuit onto a PCB.\nI rushed to dig out the files for one of my old, small PCBs, which you can see on the right, and ran it through my improved drawing process. I had the printer draw it on paper, just to see what it would end up looking like, and the results were pretty encouraging.\nThe paper somewhat absorbed the ink, as paper is wont to do, so there was some seepage, but overall the results looked like they should definitely work on copper. This is that first attempt:\nThis looked very promising.\nThe Improved Drawing Process The original process (where I exported stuff to an image and then converted the image to a 3D model with the slicer) worked well enough, but it was meant for working with 3D models, not circuits. As such, it could sometimes lose accuracy, which doesn’t really matter if you’re printing a figurine, but does matter if it means your circuit is no longer working.\nFortunately, there is an excellent open source project called pcb2gcode, which converts Gerber files to Gcode for various CAD tools to execute it. The Gcode that pcb2gcode outputs wasn’t compatible with my Marlin-style printer, so I adapted my script from above to turn the output to something my printer can run.\nMy script does various things:\nIt removes commands that are incompatible with or unsafe to run on my printer (e.g. drilling commands, as it has no drill, temperature and extrusion commands, as I don’t want it to heat up or extrude, etc). It rewrites comments so that they are compatible with my printer (pcb2gcode comments use parentheses, my printer uses semicolons). It makes sure all movements are within some specified coordinates, so the print head can’t go too low or too high by mistake. It allows me to offset all drawing commands by some distance, so I can print exactly where I want to. Unfortunately, as you can see on the photo of the paper drawing above, pcb2gcode has a bug where traces that are too narrow disappear, but the author is actively working on it and I worked around it in the mean time just by setting a lower marker tip diameter.\nOnce everything was done on the programming side, and with lots of help from my friend Andrew, it was time to actually try and draw on copper. Here’s a video of the attempt:\n[Drawing a PCB on Copper Clad Video Link]\nEtching Surprisingly (and as my friend Josh rubbed in with what I imagine to be considerable glee), the actual etching part wasn’t as easy as I thought. It wasn’t hard, but it also didn’t consist of just throwing the PCB in acid and waiting.\nI’m still in a trial-and-error phase, as I’ve only etched two PCBs, but it seems like 100 grams of water with the appropriate amount of sodium persulfate dissolved in it is only good enough to etch a tiny PCB. If that’s true, it will take a lot of acid to etch a larger one, but I’ll have to experiment and see what happens.\nUPDATE: Some commenters on HN pointed out that the reason this took so long was that I didn’t have a copper plane. I decided against that\n","permalink":"https://mikeei.github.io/blog/blog_post_2023_07_10_2/","summary":"Make Your Own PCBs with a 3D Printer Conceived on Feb 14, 2020\nSeries: sideprojects, cad, hardware\nListen, anyone can make a PCB at home, it’s easy.

It\u0026rsquo;s excellent for running short-lived workloads, which is why it\u0026rsquo;s the backbone of AWS Lambda. Our initial prototype for Hocus, a self-hosted alternative to Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces, utilized Firecracker. However, after weeks of testing, we decided to entirely replace it with QEMU. A little-known fact about Firecracker is its lack of support for many modern hypervisor features, such as dynamic RAM management, which is vital for long-lived workloads. In this post, I will explain why Firecracker might not be the best hypervisor choice and when you should avoid it.\nFirecracker Optimizes for Short-Lived Workloads The creators of Firecracker state that:\n\u0026ldquo;Firecracker has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM.\u0026rdquo;\nThe term \u0026ldquo;unnecessary\u0026rdquo; is intriguing - if this functionality is unnecessary, why was it incorporated into other hypervisors? The definition of \u0026ldquo;unnecessary\u0026rdquo; must be understood in the context of what Firecracker was built for. These excluded features are unnecessary for AWS Lambda, which spins up VMs to run short function calls and then shuts them down. If you\u0026rsquo;re running a different kind of workload, like a VM that contains your development environment or a self-hosted GitHub Actions agent, these features cease to be unnecessary. Your VM will run for hours, days, or even months without stopping, unlike the typical Firecracker VM, which runs for seconds or minutes.\nFirecracker, Not So Lightweight After All Here are the two most significant features Firecracker lacks:\nDynamic memory management - Firecracker\u0026rsquo;s RAM footprint starts low, but once a workload inside allocates RAM, Firecracker will never return it to the host system. After running several workloads inside, you end up with an idling VM that consumes 32 GB of RAM on the host, even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any of it. Discard operations on storage - if you create a 10 GB file inside a VM and then delete it, the backing space won\u0026rsquo;t be reclaimed on the host. The VM will occupy that disk space until you delete the entire VM drive. These deficiencies make Firecracker a memory and disk space hog. The plot below shows the memory usage of the same memory-intensive workload running in QEMU and Firecracker virtual machines.\nThe workload in Firecracker finishes running around the 200-second mark, and in QEMU around the 250-second mark. It\u0026rsquo;s not a performance difference; it\u0026rsquo;s just when I manually stopped them.\nOther Features Firecracker Is Missing GPU support - if you need a GPU inside the VM, you have to pick a different hypervisor. High-performance disk IO - when you connect multiple drives to the VM and run intensive IO operations, you will likely run into a bottleneck. Firecracker uses a virtio-blk implementation that isn’t as memory-hungry as alternatives, but has a smaller throughput. QEMU is Not Perfect Though The main issue we\u0026rsquo;ve had with QEMU is that it has too many options you need to configure. For instance, enabling your VM to return unused RAM to the host requires at least three challenging tasks:\nKnowing that the feature even exists (it\u0026rsquo;s called free page reporting and you have to specifically enable it in QEMU) Understanding that an obscure feature of Linux called DAMON exists, knowing what it\u0026rsquo;s for, knowing how to configure it, and compiling a guest Linux kernel that supports it Knowing that you need to disable transparent huge pages on the guest, otherwise the VM will never return large amounts of memory It took us two months of experimentation, reading through the source code of Firecracker, QEMU, and other hypervisors to develop a reliable QEMU proof of concept. To comprehend DAMON configuration, my co-founder spent days running benchmarks and conversing with one of its authors. It\u0026rsquo;s great that we could talk and we are grateful that the author spent the time to help us, but it shows that the technology is not easily accessible yet.\nConclusion QEMU has the features you need to run general-purpose workloads, but configuring it requires a lot of time and patience. If you want to run short-lived, untrusted workloads, Firecracker is a great choice. However, if you just want to run your development environment in a VM, you can use Hocus. We\u0026rsquo;ve done all the hard work for you already. It\u0026rsquo;s still in alpha, but you can already check it out on GitHub.\nTags: qemu, firecracker\n","permalink":"https://mikeei.github.io/blog/blog_post_2023_07_10/","summary":"Why We Replaced Firecracker with QEMU July 10, 2023\nHugo Dutka\nCo-founder at Hocus\nFirecracker, the microVM hypervisor, is renowned for being lightweight, fast, and secure.
