## What's New in PHP 8.1? {#whats-new}

PHP 8.1 introduces several new features and improvements, including:

- **Enums:** A typesafe way of defining a type with a finite set of values.
- **Fibers:** A solution for running asynchronous code using synchronous syntax.
- **Never Return Type:** Useful for indicating that a function will not return a value.

## Installing PHP 8.1 {#installing-php-8-1}

To install PHP 8.1 on your system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Windows Users:** Download the PHP 8.1 VC15 x64 Non Thread Safe version from the [PHP Downloads page](https://windows.php.net/download).
2. **Mac Users:** Use Homebrew by typing `brew install php@8.1` in your Terminal.
3. **Linux Users:** Use the package manager of your distribution to install PHP 8.1.

## Exploring Key Features {#key-features}

Now that PHP 8.1 is installed, let's explore its key features:

### Enums

Enums are used to create a type that consists of a finite set of values. Here is an example:

```php
enum Status: string {
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Archived = 'archived';
}
```

### Fibers

Fibers allow developers to write asynchronous code using a more traditional, synchronous coding style. Here's a basic example of how fibers can be used:

```php
$fiber = new Fiber(function (): void {
    echo "Running inside the fiber\n";
});

$fiber->start();
```

### Never Return Type

The never return type is used to indicate that a function does not return. The function either throws an exception or ends the scriptâ€™s execution. Here is an example:

```php
function redirect(string $url): never {
    header('Location: ' . $url);
    exit;
}
```
