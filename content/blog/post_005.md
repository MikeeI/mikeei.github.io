Among the highlights of PHP 8.1 is the introduction of enums, a feature that has long been requested by PHP developers. Enums, or enumerations, allow developers to define a type that has a few preset values, making code more readable and less prone to errors.

Another notable feature in PHP 8.1 is the new readonly properties. This feature allows developers to declare properties that cannot be changed after initialization, providing an additional layer of security and predictability in PHP applications.

PHP 8.1 also introduces fibers for handling asynchronous code. While PHP is traditionally synchronous, fibers allow for more efficient handling of I/O-bound PHP code, such as network, database, or file system access.
