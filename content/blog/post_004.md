If 'Alien 5' were to come to fruition, there's no telling where the story could go. One possibility is the return of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in some form, continuing the trend set by 'Alien: Resurrection.' With her complex relationship with the Xenomorphs, Ripley's involvement would ensure a compelling narrative.

The film could also delve deeper into the Xenomorphs' origins and their home world, a concept touched upon in 'Prometheus' and 'Alien: Covenant.' This exploration could provide a fresh perspective on the aliens and the franchise as a whole.
