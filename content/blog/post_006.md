CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. From typography to layout, CSS is a fundamental tool for web development.

CSS's main benefit is that it allows developers to separate the website's content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

One of CSS's core features is the ability to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. By changing one CSS file, you can modify the look of an entire website. This ability makes CSS an incredibly efficient tool for maintaining large sites.

CSS is also responsive, which means it can ensure that web pages look good on devices of all sizes. With features like media queries, you can create different layouts for different screen sizes.
